# Mapping_Earthquakes
Building web based maps showing earthquake data, using javascript, GeoJSON data, leaflet, D3, and mapBox.

## Overview:
The purpose of this project is to visually show the quantities and magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. Using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days.

Use JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data and utilizing the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Resources:
- Software: Mapbox, Javascipt, D3.js library, Leaflet library, HTML5
- Data: 
  - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
  - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
  - Tectonic plate GeoJSON data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json
